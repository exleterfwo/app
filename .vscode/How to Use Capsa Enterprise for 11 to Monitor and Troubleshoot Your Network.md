Let's get started!
 
## Selecting a Network Adapter and an Analysis Profile
 
When you launch Capsa Enterprise for 11, you will see a dashboard that lets you choose a network adapter, select an analysis profile, or load packet files for replay[^2^]. You can also see a graph of network usage over time and a table of network adapter information[^2^].
 
To start capturing and analyzing network packets, you need to select a network adapter that is connected to the network you want to monitor. Capsa Enterprise for 11 supports both LANs and WLANs, including 802.11a/b/g/n[^1^]. You can also use multiple adapters to capture packets from different segments of your network.
 
After selecting a network adapter, you need to choose an analysis profile that suits your network scenario and purpose. Capsa Enterprise for 11 provides several predefined profiles, such as Full Analysis, Traffic Monitor, HTTP Analysis, Email Analysis, DNS Analysis, FTP Analysis, IM Analysis, VoIP Analysis, and Security Analysis[^1^]. You can also create your own custom profiles or modify the existing ones.
 
An analysis profile determines what kind of data Capsa Enterprise for 11 will capture and display. For example, if you choose the Full Analysis profile, Capsa Enterprise for 11 will capture all packets on the network and display various statistics, graphs, matrices, logs, reports, and alarms. If you choose the Traffic Monitor profile, Capsa Enterprise for 11 will only capture packet headers and display traffic statistics and graphs.
 
Once you have selected a network adapter and an analysis profile, you can click the Start button to begin capturing and analyzing packets.
 
## Viewing Network Statistics and Graphs
 
After starting packet capture and analysis, you will see the main interface of Capsa Enterprise for 11. The main interface consists of several tabs that show different aspects of your network. You can switch between the tabs by clicking on them.
 
The first tab is the Dashboard tab, which gives you a quick overview of your network status. It shows the total traffic volume, utilization rate, packet size distribution, error rate, broadcast rate, multicast rate, top talkers, top protocols, top conversations, top domains, top URLs, top applications, top email senders and receivers[^1^]. You can also see some graphs that show the traffic trend over time.
 
The second tab is the Summary tab,
